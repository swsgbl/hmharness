    <p align="center"><em>A Comprehensive Taxonomy of Self-Evolving Agents.</em></p>
</div>

Agentic Self-Evolving represents a paradigm shift in AI development, enabling systems to autonomously improve through three key dimensions:

- **Model-Centric Self-Evolution**: Focuses on improving the model itself through inference-based evolution (parallel sampling, sequential self-correction, structured reasoning) and training-based evolution (synthesis-driven offline and exploration-driven online self-evolving).

- **Environment-Centric Self-Evolution**: Enhances the agent's interaction with external knowledge and experience through static knowledge evolution, dynamic experience evolution, modular architecture evolution, and agentic topology evolution.

- **Model-Environment Co-Evolution**: Enables simultaneous evolution of both the model and its environment through environment training and multi-agent policy co-evolution.
